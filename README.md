# BERT-based-Hatespeech-Classifier
This hate speech classifier is built upon a fine-tuned BERT model developed by Google. It effectively classifies sentences into normal, hate speech, and offensive categories, trained on a moderate-sized real-life message corpus.

# Metrics
- Accuracy = 67.43%
- F1-score = 0.668

# Predict
To utilize the trained model for predictions, follow these steps:

1) Download the weight files from this [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iiwqL6qylWpvP0G9Gyqby06YpbP4duke/view?usp=sharing) link.

2) Place the `classifier.pth` file in the `/model` folder.

3) Run the `predict.py` file.

Feel free to leverage this powerful BERT-based classifier to categorize and analyze sentences for hate speech and offensive content.
